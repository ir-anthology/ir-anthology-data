# ir-anthology-data
This repository contains the data for the ir-anthology and a command to manage the data.

`ir-anthology.bib` contains all bib entries together with some meta data for the build process. The meta data is stored in `@misc` bib entries.
`criteria.bib` contains search criteria for targets like the dlbp and also annotates meta data about the venues. Parts of this file are merged into the `ir-anthology.bib`.

## Requirements
- ubuntu-like-os
- python3 â‰¥ 3.8.5
- pip3
- make
- bash

## First steps
Run `make` and then update the reference list with `./ir-anthology-data dblp upgrade`.

## Run the command
Run `./ir-anthology-data --help` to list all top level commands.

You can print all available subcommands of the `dblp` command with `./ir-anthology-data dblp --help`

## The dblp command
Before you run other dblp command, you should always run the `update` command first.
`./ir-anthology-data dblp update`
This will check for any new/changed entries in the dblp.

To add these new/changed entries to the ir-anthology.bib run `./ir-anthology-data dblp upgrade`. This may take a very long time if you specified new search criteria.

## Manually adding meta data
If the data is available in the primary sources (i.e. dblp XML dump), please consider modifying the `criteria.bib` accordingly. To manually add 3rd party meta data to the IR Anthology, refer to the instructions for [creating custom bib entries](./doc/custom-bib-files.md).

## Adding custom bib files
