As new manual annotations become available, they will be used to evaluate the classification performance of participating systems (that classify articles before they are manually annotated), using standard IR measures (e.g., precision, recall, accuracy), as well as hierarchical variants of them. The participants will be able to train their classifiers, using the whole history of manually annotated abstracts.",

For the first scenario, participants will be asked to provide time intervals of recognized singing birds. Participants will be allowed to use any of the provided metadata complementary to the audio content (wav format, 44.1 kHz, 48 kHz, or 96 kHz sampling rate). The task is focused on developing real-world applicable solutions and therefore requires participants to submit single models trained on none other than the mono-species recordings provided as training data. For the second task on stereophonic recordings, the goal will be to determine the species singing in chorus simultaneously during a time interval. In contrast to task one, the challengers are invited to run automatic source separation before or jointly to the bird species classification, taking advantage of the multi-channel recordings. Participants will be allowed to use any other data than the provided recordings, but will have to provide the scripts to check that their solution is fully automatic.

In the full retrieval subtask, the runs are expected to rank documents based on their relevance to the query, where documents can be retrieved from the full document collection provided. This subtask models the end-to-end retrieval scenario. In the reranking subtask, participants were provided with an initial ranking of 100 documents, giving all participants the same starting point. This is a common scenario in many real-world retrieval systems that employ a telescoping architecture [Matveeva et al., 2006, Wang et al., 2011]. The reranking subtask allows participants to focus on learning an effective relevance estimator, without the need for implementing an end-to-end retrieval system. It also makes the reranking runs more comparable, because they all rerank the same set of 100 candidates. The initial top-100 rankings were retrieved using Indri [Strohman et al., 2005] on the full corpus with Krovetz stemming and stopwords eliminated. Judgments are on a four-point scale: [3] Perfectly relevant: Document is dedicated to the query, it is worthy of being a top result in a search engine. [2] Highly relevant: The content of this document provides substantial information on the query. [1] Relevant: Document provides some information relevant to the query, which may be minimal. [0] Irrelevant: Document does not provide any useful information about the query.

Participants could submit up to 1000 passages per query for this end-to-end retrieval task. In the top-1000 reranking subtask, 1000 passages per query were provided to participants, giving all participants the same starting point. The sets of 1000 were generated based on BM25 retrieval with no stemming as applied to the full collection. Participants were expected to rerank the 1000 passages based on their estimated likelihood of containing an answer to the query.

It is therefore difficult to identify primary affected locations (whereas hurricanes or wildfires are geographically constrained).

We want to look at a particular case for linking: given that the user is reading a specific article (the query article), algorithms should recommend articles that this person should read next that are the most useful for providing context and background for the query article.

In the first two years of the track, we worked on ranking entities within the document as to their priority for linking. For this year, the task was grown into a full wikification task. Wikification is providing Wikipedia-like markup in a document by linking related content to contextually-relevant anchors. The goal of wikification depends on the application; in Wikipedia, the goal is to link articles to other articles as cross-references. For news reading, we imagine that wikification could be used to recommend interstitial links to the author or editor of the article, where those links serve a similar function to results in the background linking task: provide essential background and context to the reader of the article. This definition of wikification differs in some important ways from the natural language processing field s version, where it essentially means linking entities in the article (which may be a Wikipedia article) to other Wikipedia articles. First, we do not restrict the anchor to entity mentions but rather they can be any contiguous span of text within a block. Second, the target of the link can be the knowledge base (Wikipedia) or another article in the Post. Lastly, the task is formulated as ranked recommendation, so high performance is modeled by selecting useful anchors and linking them in a way that provides context to the user, instead of complete and correct entity linking. The task is operationalized as follows: Given the same starting article as in the background linking task, systems were to provide a ranked list of link anchors and suggestions. A link anchor was a triple of content block number, starting 6 character, and anchor length, defining an extent of characters in the document. The suggested target for the anchor could be either another Washington Post article, or a Wikipedia article in the provided Wikipedia dump. Individual (anchor, target) pairs are ranked by the system-provided score as in a traditional TREC run. At the time that the task was released to participants, the rubric for relevance judgments was not yet set, although the coordinators had expected the scheme to mirror that of background linking. However, as the assessment plan was developed, it was clear that a wikification result could be poor for multiple reasons. Thus, the following two-level, four-part scheme was used: 1. is the anchor sensible, that is, does it break on word boundaries and seem reasonable in a  lexical  sense? Anchors that break in the middle of words or awkwardly in the middle of phrases are not sensible. 2. is the anchor useful, that is, would a link at that place in the document possible help the reader better understand the article? Converting a noun phrase that has no bearing on the main topic of the article would be sensible, but not useful. 3. does the target match the anchor? Is the target document what the reader would reasonably expect to be linked from that anchor? Linking the text  Justin Bieber  to the Wikipedia page for Barack Obama would not match, although the anchor seems sensible and is conceivably useful. 4. is the target helpful? Does the content in the linked article provide background information or context for understanding the topic document? This is essentially the relevance criterion in the background linking task.",

The provided transcripts have word-level time-stamps on a granularity of 0.1s which allows retrieval systems to index the contents by time osets. A segment was defined to be a two-minute chunk starting on the minute; e.g. [0.0-119.9] seconds, [60-199.9] seconds, [120-139.9] seconds, etc. Segments overlap each other by one minute - any segment except for the first and last segment is covered by the preceding and following segments. The rationale for creating overlapping segments is to account for the case where a phrase or sentence is split across segment boundaries. This creates 3.4M segments in total from the document collection with an average word count of 340   70 per segment. Topics consist of a topic number, keyword query, a type label, and a description of the user s information need. Eight topics were given at the outset for the participants to practice on, and 50 topics were released as the test task. Topics were formulated in three types: topical, re-finding, and known item. Example topics are given in Figure 2.",

Specifically, the task focused on identifying critical evidence for or against the treatment in the specific population represented by the type of cancer and genetic mutation(s) in the topic. The topic structure is close to the Evidence Based Medicine (EBM)  PICO  framework, where the problem/population (P) is the cancer and its mutations, the intervention (I) is the treatment, the comparison (C) is an alternative treatment, and the outcomes (O) are the endpoints of a cancer study, such as event-free survival, quality of life or time to progression. This framework was designed to find the most relevant scientific articles for an individual patient, specifically searching the scientific literature in PubMed. The EBM notion of relevance combines topical evidence with the strength of evidence. The task emulated this notion and required strong evidence for the treatment (whether positive or negative) to be ranked over weaker evidence. There are often many treatments for a particular type of cancer and particular genetic mutations, so a useful clinical decision support tool will help oncologists narrow the treatment decision to the one most likely to help the patient. This is why strong negative evidence is important: it helps eliminate the treatment so that a more efficacious treatment can be chosen instead. The idea is to provide oncologists with the evidence that best helps them make a decision when evaluating competing alternatives. The primary literature corpus is therefore a snapshot of MEDLINE abstracts (i.e., what is searchable through the PubMed interface). The same MEDLINE-baseline snapshot that was used for the 2019 track was used this year. Of course, this collection should not be used to provide real-time decision support in 2020, but it is large enough to support the goals of this evaluation. Specifically, this corpus is composed of 29,138,916 MEDLINE abstracts.",
